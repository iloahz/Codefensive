Introduction
============

This is a geek thing trying to make the source code unreadable.  
Now(2011-7-3) I consider the final product to be a webpage, so ```PHP``` is chosen as the process language.  
Now I will start with ```C++``` source code, and I believe this project will be able to process more programming languages, so I will think carefully for the architecture. ^.^

Algorithm
=========

* Replace all the variables with the combination of '-' and '\_'
* Replace `if-else` with `?:`
* Transform loops(e.g. ```for```, ```while```, ```do-until```) to recursive functions
* Replace constants with variables

Updates
=======

Update 2011-7-5:  
	Since I am not familiar with PHP....So I plan to use ```C++``` or ```Python``` as the process language. Still we can create a webpage with CGI to achieve the same function.
