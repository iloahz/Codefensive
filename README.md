This is a geek thing trying to make the source code unreadable.  
Now(2011-7-3) I consider the final product to be a webpage, so PHP is chosen as the process language.  
Now I will start with C++ source code, and I believe this project will be able to process more programming languages, so I will think carefully for the architecture. ^.^

Update 2011-7-5:  
	Since I am not familiar with PHP...So I plan to use C++ as the process language. Still we can create a webpage with CGI to achieve the same function.
